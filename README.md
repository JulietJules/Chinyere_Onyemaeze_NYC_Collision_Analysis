Power BI analysis of NYC motor vehicle collisions (Jan–Aug 2020), focusing on accident trends, high-risk periods, locations, and contributing factors.

**NYC Motor Vehicle Collisions Analysis (Jan–Aug 2020)**

   This project analyzes motor vehicle collisions reported by the New York City Police Department between January and August 2020. Each record represents a single collision and contains information on the date, time, location, vehicles involved, victims, and contributing factors. The goal of this analysis is to use Power BI to identify accident trends, high-risk periods, locations, and major contributing factors that influence both total and fatal accidents.

Data Source: NYC Motor Vehicle Collisions Dataset

**Analysis Objectives**
1. How are accidents distributed by month, and are there noticeable seasonal patterns?
2. On which days of the week and hours of the day do accidents occur most frequently?
3. Which street recorded the highest number of accidents, and what percentage of total accidents does it represent?
4. What are the most common contributing factors to accidents and fatal accidents?

Tools Used: Power BI, DAX (Data Analysis Expressions), Power Query and GitHub (Project Documentation)

**Key Insights**
1. Accident frequency declined significantly between March and May 2020, which aligns with COVID-19 lockdown restrictions and reduced road usage.
From June onward, accidents increased again as movement and economic activities gradually resumed. This shows a strong relationship between traffic volume and accident frequency.
2. Accidents occur more frequently on weekdays than weekends. Peak accident hours are observed during morning and evening commuting periods. This suggests that work-related travel and traffic congestion play a major role in accident occurrence.
3. The street with the highest number of reported accidents represents only a small percentage of total citywide collision. This indicates that accidents are widely distributed across New York City rather than being concentrated on a single road.
4. Driver inattention and Unsafe speed was identified as the most common contributing factor for Total accidents and Fatal accidents. This highlights the significant impact of human behavior on road safety outcomes.

**Additional Insights:**
1. Reduced traffic movement leads to fewer accidents.
2. Commuting hours consistently present higher accident risks.
3. Behavioral factors contribute more to severe accidents than environmental conditions.

**Recommendations**:
1. Increase public awareness campaigns focused on reducing distracted driving.
2. Improve traffic monitoring and enforcement during peak commuting hours.
3. Implement targeted safety interventions on identified high-risk streets.

In Conclusion, this project demonstrates how data visualization and analysis can be used to extract meaningful insights from traffic collision data. The findings emphasize the influence of mobility patterns and driver behavior on road safety in New York City.
